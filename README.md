# Sheet-music-reader-GTK
Sheet music reader and organiser on GTK framework

I am in the process of rewriting the code I had because I couldn't get the correct
packages installed on my PostmarketOs device.
This version is tested and some features work, like persistent zoom level and scroll per page.

Library is in the process to be added. You can select a base folder where you store your music, which is stored persistently.
In this folder you make a folder for each orchestra where you put all your pdfs, and a separate folder named "Concert" which will be used for managing concert order.
Every time you open the app you can select which orchestra you need the music for.

What I am working on now is to make a concert order so you can continually click next to advance to next page and/or piece.

Annotations work partially, but are not placed accurately when pdf is rotated.
I added a drag button to drag annotations as a partial fix.

If someone can help with this, please do so because I am not a programmer.
