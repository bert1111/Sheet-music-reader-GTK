# Sheet-music-reader-GTK
Sheet music reader and organiser on GTK framework

I am in the process of rewriting the code I had because I couldn't get the correct
packages installed on my PostmarketOs device.
This version is tested and some features work, like persistent zoom level and scroll per page.

Library is to be added.
Annotations work partially, but are not placed accurately when pdf is rotated.

If someone can help with this, please do so because I am not a programmer.
